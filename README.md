# Ecommerce-Database-System-Design-and-Implementation
Database schema and EER design for a scalable ecommerce platform.

This project showcases a fully normalized, relational database system designed for a modern ecommerce platform. It includes a comprehensive **EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) diagram**, **SQL schema**, and logical design documentation.

## üìò Overview

The database supports essential ecommerce operations such as:

- User registration and customer management
- Product cataloging and categorization
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order tracking and processing
- Inventory control
- Delivery scheduling
- Employee roles and access control

This system was designed with scalability, data integrity, and real-world applicability in mind.

## üß† Key Entities

Some of the core entities modeled in the system include:

- `CUSTOMERS`
- `PRODUCTS`
- `ORDERS` and `ORDER_ITEMS`
- `CATEGORIES`
- `EMPLOYEES`, with subclasses like `DRIVERS` and `CLERKS`
- `DELIVERIES`
- `INVENTORY`
- `ROLES` and `PERMISSIONS`

All tables use UUIDs for primary keys, and triggers are implemented to normalize specific fields during inserts/updates.
